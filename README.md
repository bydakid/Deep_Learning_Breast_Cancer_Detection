**Using CNNs for Mammogram Classification**  

This project explores the application of deep learning—specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—for breast cancer detection using mammogram images. It evaluates how well these models perform compared to radiologists and aims to support early cancer diagnosis through assistive AI tools.

## About

### Research Focus  
The project investigates the effectiveness of CNNs in detecting malignant and benign breast cancer cases from the CBIS-DDSM dataset, with model evaluation aligned to clinical standards.

### Theme Inspiration  
Inspired by the role of early detection in cancer survival, this project addresses the potential of AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce radiologist workload through automation and decision support.
